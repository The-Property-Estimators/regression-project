<h4>Kwame and Gabby, Codeup Darden Cohort</h4>
<h2> About the project</h2>
<h3>Goals</h3>
Kwame and Gabby want to predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses using the property data from those whose last transaction was during the peak real estate demand months of May and June 2017.
<h3>How to reproduce the results</h3>
You may download acquire.py and prepare.py. You will need your own env.py file with your SQL credentials in order to access the SQL server.
